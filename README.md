# SCP-Documents

## Workshop Version
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823393413

## Description
Document all your anomalies within your SCP server with ease! Never before has it been easy to load your SCP documents, it's so easy it's just a simple drag and drop!

Currently there are 35 default documents already within the addon, you are free to add more.

## How To Use
Unlike other addons, this addon only uses one entity and can have it's document changed using the context menu (C menu), you must be an admin+ to be able to change the document.

To interact with the document, simply press E and read it's contents. Once you are finished with it, you may close the document by clicking your mouse anywhere on screen.

## For Developers/Curious Folk
The reason I made this instead of just using another addon was due to how document loading was handled. Having loads of separate entities for each entity felt like a headache, I decided to create my own and spare myself the torment.

To add a new document to your game, simply move an image with the following naming scheme documentname_documentation into materials/ryanm2711/scp_documents/

## Limitations
Currently the only limitation to this system is that it only accepts PNG, JPG, and VTF image formats.
